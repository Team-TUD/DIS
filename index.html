We are the Distributed Intelligent Systems Lab at the Distributed Systems Section, EWI faculty, TU Delft. We working on a wide variety of research problems in distributed machine learning systems, and developing cutting edge AI technology for industry. Check our start-up spin-off, <a href="https://www.generatrix.ai/"> Generatrix</a>.

<br>
<br>

Our lab is supported by TU Delft, Aegon, ABB Research, Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), and Dutch National Science Foundation (NWO).
